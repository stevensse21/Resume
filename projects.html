                            This is a simulation of Zombies (the red dots) taking over Humans (the white dots) and displays GUI skills in Java and comes from an assignment from a software engineering course. Characters cannot exit the screen or enter the buildings. If they are heading in the direction of doing so, they turn away. They have a 10% chance of turning if they are not interfered with. The simulation also begins with 1 zombie. This zombie follows the same rules as the humans, yet has a 20% chance of changing directions if not interfered with. A zombie can be added to the simulation by clicking on the simulation with the mouse. The location of the cursor when clicked is the location of the zombie that is added. This zombie follows the same rules as the randomly generating zombies, except the x and y coordinates are not random and, instead, decided by the mouse click. If the mouse click occurs over a building, nothing will happen, since a zombie cannot be in a building. This project uses GUIS for visualization.

                            My Virtual Reality App, called Underwater Treasure Hunt, is a virtual simulation of the user travelling underwater in the ocean, trying to collect treasure. They will begin in a start room, that explains the rules of the game. Should they choose to play the game, they will be transported to their home base and have a path to follow as they swim through coral, trying to find the treasure. A fish will swim up and lead the user to the treasure using the shortest path. However, their path can become blocked if a shark appears and block the user’s path. If the user chooses not to follow the fish, the fish will follow the user than recalculate the shortest path from the user’s current position to the treasure. After the treasure is collected, the user will be transported to the ending room, displaying their stats.

                            This is integration project takes a current student at GWU through the processes of being a student. Once admitted, students are able to use this platform throughout their years at GWU. Each semester, students are able to register for courses of their choice. Their options can vary in professor and time scheduling, allowing them to choose the optimal schedule to graduate on time. To prepare for graduation, the students must submit a Form 1, detailing the courses they plan to take to fulfill their program's (Masters or PhD) requirements. This Form automatically goes through an audit, ensuring their plan allows them to graduate. When the time comes, students will be able to apply for graduation. Once approved, they become alumunus and can now only have access to their transcripts from when they were students at the University. This assignment comes from a Databases course.

                           <p>Other users included on this platform are faculty members (who also act as advisors), the graduate secretary, 
    and the system administrator. Faculty members are also instructors for courses. They are able to access all of the courses 
    they teach in a given semester, as well as the transcripts of the students in their courses. Additionally, faculty can add final grades for their 
    students. As advisors, faculty members have the ability to review the Form 1 submissions of their advisees to ensure they are on the right path to 
    graduation. In the special case of PhD students, advisors are able to approve the thesis of their PhD advisees. The graduate secretary is able to 
    override any course grade entries a faculty may have added. They are also responsible for assigning advisors to students, and approving a student to 
    graduate. The system administrator has access to all of the capabilities of the faculty and graduate secretary.</p>

Once pressing start, the user will have the ability to select one of three of Andy Warhol’s pop art pieces to hang on their wall. After selecting which piece, the user will have the option of changing the variation of the piece, since Warhol was known for creating many variations of the same design. The user will also have the ability to select an icon that will give them more information about that piece. The user will be able to add a maximum of three pieces to their gallery, one of each type, a Campell’s can, cow, or flower. They will be able to add only one piece at a time, so it occurs step-by-step. If they want to move, rotate, or scale their art, they must click on the art icon again to adjust is as they please. On the home screen, the user will also have the ability to scan other pieces done by Warhol with their camera. Scanning will create a popup of more information about the creation of the art. On all of the screens, the user will also be able to select a (?) icon to get more information about Andy Warhol.

                            The Search Engine alogirthm relies on the use of a hashmap, where files are arbitrarily read in from a directory of documents, with each bucket in the hashmap containing a linkedlist of words, and each word contains a linkedlist of associated documents. The program accepts a string from user input and searches for each word, seperated by a space, to determine the frequency each word falls in a document. It ranks the presence in each document and presents the documents in order of most to least frequent. This project is from an assignment in a Computer Architecture course.

                            The goal of this project is to analyze the data given: temperature, pressure, humidity, and an indicator of whether or not it rained at different times of the day. To be able to understand the data, it is broken into three histograms and the data stored in buckets, depending on the reading. The packets of readings are sent one per second, with each packet being an hour's worth of data. This process is split in two. This splitting occurs with forking and pipes. The two pipes, signal and data, communicate by sending user input to the arduino with signal and reading data with the data pipe. This is done through the child process. The parent process does the other half, reading signals from the arduino and sending data through the data pipe. Therefore, the child process works primarily with the front end and user input, while the parent process works with the back end and arduino process. This project is from an assignment in a Systems Programming course.
